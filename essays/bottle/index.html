		<h2>In Search of Bottle Perfection</h2>
	</div>


	<div class="body">
		<p>Its function so seemingly simple, yet its form so inherently misunderstood. Geometry tells us the most efficient shell-to-volume figure is a sphere. But everyday practicality tells us otherwise. From the mundane to the marvelous, a water bottle has the ability to be much more than a vessel for water. I would like to tell the story of my own water bottle upbringing and my findings from from the field.</p> <p>I have not always been a water bottle connoisseur. In fact, I have been chronically dehydrated for most of my life. I would take long sips at the water fountain between my classes, blithely ignorant to a life where water was easily accessible and readily available. The idea of the water bottle just never passed my threshold of worthiness. I saw my classmates sip tea from their cat mugs or even chug water from mini Arrowhead jugs. But in my mind, I separated exercise and daily life through my water consumption. I was not profusely sweating in the classroom as I was when muscling up steep inclines on my bicycle. So daily hydration was like wearing sunglasses indoors. It seemed unnecessary, even distasteful.</p> <p>The exact moment I decided to dedicate a water bottle to daily life has escaped me. My intuition tells me it began three years ago at a pre-college summer program at the University of Mississippi. The heat and humidity of the oppressive Ole Miss sun soon blurred my distinction between athletics and daily life. Coming from a foggy San Francisco summer, I was not used to sweating while sedentary. It was a genuinely unpleasant feeling, as if I had an undiagnosed chronic illness. I browsed the assortment of water bottles at the Ole Miss store one day and fancied the possibility of available water, all the time. I walked out that day with a water bottle to call my own. That single bottle would be my prescription for dehydration for nearly a year.</p> <p>Hydration was not as essential in the overcast mornings of San Francisco as it was in Mississippi. But I was used to carrying that Ole Miss bottle everywhere to combat the summer humidity, sipping at the slightest tinge of thirst. Back home, this sipping habit became something more. Whenever the teacher had lost me in her ramblings about the Spanish imperfect tense, I would casually move my bottle from my desk to my mouth, slowly inhale, and return to the present. A sip from my bottle became my moment of second-long clarity. I would bite the nozzle and focus on the slight gurgle of rushing water, the chill of true liquid gold, and the new scratches on the Ole Miss logo. I was completely oblivious to the hectic hustle of the classroom, if only for a moment. I would then see my surroundings through reinvigorated eyes as I returned the bottle to the desk. I like to say that a hydrated body is a hydrated mind. I was more focused in the classroom, keenly aware that water was constantly lubricating, flushing out toxins, and feeding my hungry mind as it rushed to memorize Flamenco terms like 'duende' and 'cantes a palo seco.'</p> <p>Soon enough, my Ole Miss water bottle became an extension of self. Just like the artsy girl with the cat mug, I wanted to differentiate myself in a world of Camelback and Kleen Kanteen. I swelled with satisfaction each time I carried my water bottle. The Ole Miss logo embodied a culture entirely different from my politically correct home. I was more than just a San Francisco boy. I had seen the culture of Mississippi under sweltering sun, and my authentic water bottle proved it.</p> <p>All was swell in my water bottle world until it was not. One day I was sipping away, as content as a ripe nectarine, and the next I had nothing besides a marginally lighter backpack. I had forgotten it in the computer lab, or maybe the metal shop. All that mattered was it was gone. I returned to the lost & found for a month, but in the drawer of lost bottles and mugs, my Ole Miss was absent. Perhaps it hung on the wall of the teacher's lounge unseen by students. Maybe a Southern boy in my unfamiliar city longed for a taste of home, and the crimson red of the Ole Miss logo was what he yearned for when he came across my seemingly abandoned bottle. My mind ran through the infinite possibilities but it was in vain. Ole Miss was gone.</p> <p>Kobayashi Issa, a great haiku master of the 18th century, once wrote: 'This world of dew is a world of dew. And yet, an yet. . .' Rather than dew, the film of San Francisco fog coated my lungs with sadness as I tried to move on. Yet every time I returned to that lost & found with a tinge of possibility, I was ultimately disappointed. So after another mug-less day, I spotted an unloved Starbucks mug in the lost & found drawer. I had never seen it before, but I appreciated how the white ceramic shaped to the curve of my hands. I reasoned that its owner would have a greater chance of reconnecting with it in my grasp than hidden in a drawer. I felt morally freed in my justification, but I doubted the owner would notice their mug or have the audacity to ask me if it was theirs. So I was wrought with surprise when a freshmen walked up to me in the hallway one day, and in a tone laced with accusation, inquired if the mug I was sipping from was hers. I let out a guilty 'probably' and handed it to her. The hot water still inside sloshed a final goodbye as that mug too departed from my life.</p> <p>The following months were a blur. I experimented, changing bottles as often as the musical notes during a jazz solo. I dabbled with bite nozzles that were socially acceptable chew toys. I tried the double insulated steel bottles and could never go back to plastic Nalgenes and the condensation that left water marks on wooden tables. I appreciated the small mouth and curved profile of a particular bottle, but hated how its narrow diameter caused it to fly from my backpack's pouch as I ran to catch th morning bus. Every bottle I tried dazzled me in some way or another, but perfection was always fleeting. As much as I wanted to appreciate each bottle, the minor flaws itched more than the benefits soothed my critical mind. As bottley adventurous as I was, I never found the one I was looking for.</p> <p>You would think that after my breadth of experience, I would have some artisanal bottle handcrafted in Switzerland by now. A bottle that combined everything I had ever hoped for. The arduous search would be well worth it as I sipped ice water from the double wall insulation and saw my own content reflection in the polished mirror surface. I smile at such fancifulness as I tip back lukewarm water from my mug. Expectation can be far from reality.</p> <p>I painted the mug I could finally call my own at an art studio back home. Shelves of pottery drew me past painting children and patient mothers. I brushed my hand against the bare ceramic and shuddered as a swirl of colorful paint possibilities stumped my uncertain mind. The tiny plastic containers of glaze along the counter further perplexed me with a plethora of orange and blue. I inspected the colorful containers as the children reached for them with their tiny hands. I admired their spontaneity, how the children did not dwell on the characteristics of the color wheel or concern themselves with the complementary color triads. So I decided to push against the creative burden that a semester of rigorous design studio had instilled in me. The first brush strokes on the bare mug softened the pensive atmosphere. By the time my wrist began to ache, the desire for careful planning had succumbed to the waves of glaze. I came back a week later to pick up my post-kiln mug and smiled at how me it was, sure to have it in my grasp as I returned to the frigid New York winter. A mug full of warm tea and a fluffy winter jacket was all my optimism needed to survive.</p> <p>My mug is a far cry from bottle perfection. After a semester of use, I could go on about its myriad flaws. If the mug is empty, I can feel its broad diameter and hefty weight when it clanks around in my backpack. Even worse, I tend to spill hot tea on my hand as I briskly walk to class. Unless I pour the half-sipped tea on the ground as I rush to Klarman Hall or the Statler, the mug wholly debilitates my punctuality. If a professor eyes me as I scurry to an open seat in discussion section, I blame my chronic lateness on my mug, knowing very well that I am at fault.</p> <p>The binge searches for beautiful water bottles never amount to anything besides fanciful dreams. No matter how much I dwell on the negatives of the mug, I can never escape its sentimental pull. The inconsistency of its brush strokes offers a handmade touch. The inside has turned a tinted brown from unwashed layers of tea. The boldness of the ceramic has a way of attracting attention from my classmates and professors. The longer I have lived in this world, the more I have realized that the intrigue of the perfect bottle is simply that: intrigue. At least that is what I tell myself as I sip peach tea from my deeply flawed, deeply personal mug.</p>
