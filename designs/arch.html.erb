		<h3>Where pixel perfect matters.</h3>
		<p>
			I almost went to formal architecture school instead of the multidisciplinary design program at Cornell. While in Ithaca, I have been able to strike a balance between digital and architectural design through Design + Environmental Analysis and my minor in Architecture.

			Below is a sample of my architecture work.

		<p>For the final project of DEA 1150 Design Graphics & Visualization, my partner and I were tasked to create a poster showcasing an exemplar of modern architecture that would touch upon our modeling and visualization skills. We chose Pavillon dâ€™Accueil de Flaine, a visitor center designed by R Architecture in 2013 for a French ski resort because of its distinctive aesthetic and use of materials. I modeled the building using Google Sketchup, V-Ray, Autocad, Photoshop, and Indesign.

			A fictitious architecture firm, NEXT, has decided to relocate to the 32nd floor of USC Tower in downtown Los Angeles. The 11,300 SQF space will accommodate 35-45 employees. Its design must embrace collaborative and flexible ways of working in order to facilitate the innovation of tomorrow.</p>

				As the project for DEA 3301 UX Design Studio, I was tasked with researching trends and challenges facing the creative workplace. I then created the ideal office concept and design through evidence-based design and the programming information. Finally, I created a presentation package explaining the process and containing construction documents and renderings for the fictitious client.
